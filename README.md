This repository contains the source code and deployment configuration for a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It is designed to present a professional profile for myself (Dahnish Chaudhri) and is structured to ensure ease of development and deployment, following 
best practices for frontend web development. The project includes several essential files and directories for organizing the codebase. 
The index.html file is the primary entry point, defining the structure and content that users see when they load the page. It includes sections 
like a professional summary, work experience, education background, and a list of skills, and also incorporates a visitor counter to monitor site engagement. 
For styling, the /css directory contains CSS files, with a main style.css file that manages the overall layout, color scheme, typography, and responsive design. 
Additional CSS files may be included for component-specific or page-specific styling if needed. JavaScript files responsible for interactivity and dynamic 
features are stored in the /js directory. The main JavaScript file, main.js, initializes the core functionality of the site, handling user interactions,
while additional JavaScript files, such as visitor-counter.js, manage specific features like the visitor counter, dynamically tracking and displaying the
number of site visits. Static assets like images, fonts, and icons are organized in an assets/ directory for easy access and management. The repository 
also includes a deployment configuration file, deploy-frontend.yml, a YAML file that automates the deployment process. It contains commands and instructions
to deploy the frontend code to a web server or cloud platform, streamlining the workflow for updates and maintenance. This setup supports a responsive, 
user-friendly interface, making it suitable as part of a larger application or as a standalone portfolio site. It offers responsive design for accessibility
across various devices, JavaScript-enabled interactivity, and automated deployment to facilitate continuous integration and delivery.
